Many thanks to Babette Brumback for a great book to tackle the question of causality. It is extremely in my professional life which is not about making predictions but rather come up with intervention plans (business intel). The suggestions for errata are in the section Errata. Comments are also included in the section Comments. Packages The functions have been rewritten to simplify them and improve the learning experience (personal opinion) for newbies such as me. The following packages are so useful that they could not be avoided. In particular, dplyr and tidyr make the coding experience so much more interesting that one could almost claim they have become the standard in R coding. dplyr for data wrangling. see Wickham, François, et al. (2021) tidyr for data wrangling. see Wickham (2021) ggplot2 for plots, see Wickham, Chang, et al. (2021)` gt for all tables, see Iannone, Cheng, and Schloerke (2021) dagitty for analysis of structural causal models, see Textor, van der Zander, and Ankan (2021) ggdag for directed acyclic graphs, see Barrett (2021) gee: a generalized estimation equation solver. Introduced in chapter 4. See Carey, Lumley, and Ripley (2019). MonteCarlo: To perform Monte Carlo simulations. Introduced in chapter 4, section 4.2. See Leschinski (2019). simstudy: To run all sorts of simulations. A great tool to learn right from the start since simulations are so important. See Goldfeld and Wujciak-Jens (2021).

This sentence is not required if we use the boot::boot.ci() which simplifies lmodboot.r() and does not require the car package. See the code in this document for lmodboot.r in chapter 2. Chapter 4 Section 4.1 See the plots in section 4.2. They could be helpful to visualize the changes in effect measures from one level of modifier to the other. Section 4.2 Monte Carlo Simulation A Monte Carlo is provided in section 4.2 and coded in a function called betasim_effect_measures(). It uses the \\(Beta\\) distribution. It is helpful in that it confirms the same results as in Jake Shannin (2021) is less CPU intensive as it needs only 5000 iterations to confirm Jake Shannin (2021) is easier to code than java and uses R which is the declared language of Brumback (2022) allows some extra flexibility with the shape parameters of \\(Beta\\) to investigate the conclusion with diffferent curves. See the suggestion for applications below. page 72, Figure 4.1 The probabilites shown in the Venn diagram do not add up to 100% because, for example, the event that RR changes in the same direction as RD but not in the same direction as the other two measures []. It would akward to arbitrarily one of those 2 chances as zero. Jake Shannin (2021) mentions that it is the result of not mutually exclusive events. That is true. Yet, these events, properly grouped are actually mutually exclusive. In section 4.2 they are called Opposite pairwise events. Using these definitions then yes, they are mutually exclusive but cannot be properly shown in the Venn diagram. This can be easily solved by splitting the probabilities. See section 4.2 for details. The end result a proper partitioning of the sample space \\(\\Omega\\) and is, in fact, a \\(\\sigma-field\\) (See Geoffrey R. Grimmet (2001), section 1.2). Yet it does not change the conclusions reached in Jake Shannin (2021). Actually, it reinforces them as this point is extremely important when using probabilities and statistics. Applications See my sub-section 4.2 called Applications where 2 possible applications are mentioned. Data pre-processing (data cleaning) Bayesian prior for Beta-binomial model Exercises Exercise 1 Using the causal power, the conclusion is different than the official answer. It is not obvious why the official solution does not make use of the causal power. Exercise 5 The official solution uses gee with the default family, that is gaussian. Since the outcome \\(attend\\) is binary isnt it better to use the binomial family? We quote p. 50 from chapter 3 in that respect Because our outcome is binary, we choose to fit the logistic parametric model Chapter 5 The dagitty and ggdag are used extensively.
