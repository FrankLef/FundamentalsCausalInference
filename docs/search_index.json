Let \\(Y(t,a)\\) be the potential outcome for \\(Y\\) assuming we set \\(T=t\\) and then \\(A=a\\). We assume consistency \\(E(Y(t) \\mid T=t)= E(Y \\mid T=t\\)) We assume exclusion \\(Y(t,a)=Y(a)\\) Lets say that participants to treatment \\(T\\) may comply or not and let \\(A\\) be the treatment actually taken. That is \\(A=1\\) means that the treatment was taken by the participant. \\(A\\) is therefore a post-randomization event. When \\(A\\) does not equal \\(T\\) there is 2 historical methods: as-treated: Compare $E(Y A=1) with $E(Y A=0) per-protocol: We let \\(Z=1\\) if \\(A=T\\) and use ordinary stratification on \\(Z=1\\) to compare \\(E(Y \\mid T=1, Z=1)\\) with \\(E(Y \\mid T=0, Z=1)\\) \\(Z=1\\) is not a randomization event since it uses actually observed measurements after they occur. As a result \\(Z\\) cannot be expected to balance across 2 treatments groups. 9.1 Complier Average Causal Effect and Principal Stratification "]]
