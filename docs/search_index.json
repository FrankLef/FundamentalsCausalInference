The target of estimation is the linear ATT presented in chapter 6 as a risk difference \\[ \\text{Linear ATT:} \\: E(Y_1(1) - Y_1(0) \\mid A=1) \\] which is interpreted as *what is the the average difference between \\(Y_1(1)\\) and \\(Y_1(0)\\) if they all treated. For the example of the banks NIM, what is the average difference between the banks NIM in NIRP ad non-NIRP economy assuming they are all subjected to the NIRP policy, that is wihout the impact of the NIRP policy. and we have \\[ \\begin{align*} &amp; E(Y_1(1) - Y_1(0)) \\mid A=1) = \\\\ &amp; E(Y_1(1) \\mid A=1) - E(Y_1(0) \\mid A=1) = \\\\ &amp; [E(Y_1(1) \\mid A=1) - E(Y_1(0) \\mid A=1)] - [E(Y_1(0) \\mid A=0) - E(Y_1(0) \\mid A=0)] = \\\\ &amp; [E(Y_1(1) \\mid A=1) - E(Y_1(0) \\mid A=0)] - [E(Y_1(0) \\mid A=1) - E(Y_1(0) \\mid A=0)] = \\\\ &amp;\\text{consistency assumption} \\\\ &amp; [E(Y_1 \\mid A=1) - E(Y_1 \\mid A=0)] - [E(Y_1(0) \\mid A=1) - E(Y_1(0) \\mid A=0)] = \\\\ &amp;\\text{assumption A1, additive equi-confounding} \\\\ &amp;\\text{i.e. assuming that if nothing happens in year 1, then we can use the results of year 0} \\\\ &amp; [E(Y_1 \\mid A=1) - E(Y_1 \\mid A=0)] - [E(Y_0 \\mid A=1) - E(Y_0 \\mid A=0)] \\end{align*} \\] we can therefore estimate the linear ATT via the difference in differences of averages \\[ \\begin{align*} &amp;[\\hat{E}(Y_1 \\mid A=1) - \\hat{E}(Y_1 \\mid A=0)] - [\\hat{E}(Y_0 \\mid A=1) - \\hat{E}(Y_0 \\mid A=0)]= \\\\ &amp;[\\hat{E}(Y_1 \\mid A=1) - \\hat{E}(Y_0 \\mid A=1)] - [\\hat{E}(Y_1 \\mid A=0) - \\hat{E}(Y_0 \\mid A=0)]= \\\\ &amp;[\\hat{E}(Y_1 - Y_0 \\mid A=1)] - [\\hat{E}(Y_1 - Y_0 \\mid A=0)] \\end{align*} \\] We can also compute the DiD via the linear model \\[ E(Y_t \\mid A) = \\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1 t + \\alpha_2 A + \\beta A * t \\] and therefore \\[ \\begin{align*} \\beta &amp;= [E(Y_1 \\mid A=1) - E(Y_0 \\mid A=1)] - [E(Y_1 \\mid A=0) - E(Y_0 \\mid A=0)] \\\\ &amp;= (\\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2 + \\beta) - (\\alpha_0 + \\alpha_2) - ((\\alpha_0 + \\alpha_2) - (\\alpha_0)) \\end{align*} \\] As we can estimate \\(E(Y(1) \\mid A=1)\\) directly via \\(E(Y_1 \\mid A=1)\\), we can also recover \\(E(Y(0) \\mid A=1)\\) via \\(E(Y_1 \\mid A=1) - \\beta\\) "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
