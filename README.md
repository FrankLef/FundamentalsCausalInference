This is a study project of the bool *Fundamentals of Causal Inference With R*
by Babette A. Brumback. Ms Brumback uses base R for all the code. This study
project is coding with the tidyverse way. The motivation stem from the opinions
that, in practice,, the code is as important as the theory and learning
better coding practice should be strated as early as possible.

The exercises and their suggested solutions are in a separate project.

The companion package for this project is `fciR` and can be found at
